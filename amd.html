                ”あずまんが大王,” or "Azumanga Daioh," is a manga (and later anime series) written by Azuma Kiyohiko and published from
                1999 to 2002. It is a surrealist comedy comic-strip style manga, with each strip usually consisting of four panels.
                The series follows a group of high school girls and a few of their teachers as they navigate daily school life,
                going on a few adventures along the way.

                Some of the major characters include Sakaki, a cool and aloof athletic girl with a surprisingly cute interest, Chiyo, a
                genius 10-year-old who was able to test into high school, Tomo, a tomboy who is bombastic and doesn't like to think
                before she speaks, Yomi, a mild-mannered and serious girl, and Osaka, a transfer student from, well, Osaka. Much focus
                is also spent on Yukari, the girls' homeroom teacher, and her friend Minamo, the phys-ed teacher.
