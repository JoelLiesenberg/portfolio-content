                Obviously, "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, originally written by JRR Tolkien, is not an original
                Japanese work. That being said, I have always been interested in the idea of reverse translation, or translating
                a work back into its original language. I have read Tolkien's original work countless times, and while it's
                undoubtedly a challenge, I wanted to experiment and try to start dipping my toes into a full novel translation.
                This translation is done by Seita Teiji and Tanaka Akiko, and title has been translated to "指輪物語," or "Yubiwa
                Monogatari."

                In case you don't know, "The Lord of the Rings" follows a group of people who are tasked with destroying the One Ring,
                by making a perilous journey across the land of Middle-Earth and casting the ring into the fires of Mt. Doom, the volcano
                where the ring was forged by the dark lord Sauron (the titular lord of the rings). It is a fantasy epic that has left
                an idelible mark on the landscape of modern fantasy, ushering in or cementing tropes into the public consciousness of
                high fantasy. It is one of the best-selling series of all time, and has been adapted into countless media, along with
                the entire Middle-Earth mythos.
