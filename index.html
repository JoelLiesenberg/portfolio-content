                Hello all, and welcome to my translation journal. My name is Joel Liesenberg, and I am currently 
                a dual-degree Master's student at the University of Michigan, studying Japanese studies and Information Science,
                focusing in Japanese digital humanities. As an undergraduate student at Central Michigan University, I
                began to fall in love with both Japanese and linguistics, and after living in Japan for two years as part of the JET
                Program after graduation, I developed a fascination with the art of translation. Since then, I have tried to practice
                translation in my free time as part of my language study, and this website is a way for me to share my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website houses several pages, each of which offer a look into some current translation projects I have undertaken
                recently. On every page is a brief explanation of the material, its medium, its intended audience, and other pertinent
                information. After that is the journal content, which is meant to be a thought-process walkthrough as I work with
                the materials, along with examples of passages/vocabulary/grammar points that gave me a particular challenge. These
                are by no means official translations in any capability. This website is just meant to be a repository to collect my
                scraps of thought, and provide a framework to organize my various personal projects. There is also a gallery page filled
                with extra images of each project and pictures of my notes.
