                'Danganronpa' is a series of Japanese video games developed by Spike Chunsoft, that deal with a group of
                high school students who are forced into a killing-game, where in order to
                escape, they have to kill one of their classmates and get away with it. The games
                are presented in a decidedly trope-y anime style, but frequently deal with complex
                and surprisingly dark and serious themes. All of the students you meet throughout the three
                main games are considered "Ultimates," aka students who are the best in the world at something.
                Examples include the ultimate baseball star, the ultimate pop idol, the ultimate lucky student,
                and the ultimate clairvoyant. While some talents are played for laughs, most are used creatively
                to enhance each character's story, and are even sometimes incorporated into the convoluted murders
                you have to solve in each chapter.

                There are three main games in the series, with a several spinoffs (including an anime), as well as different
                game modes once the player has beaten the main story at least once. The main stories of each game are presented
                in a visual novel format that transitions to action/logic gameplay for the class trial sequences, which are largely
                the most well-known aspects of the series, and serve as the finales for each chapter. Each chapter has you solving
                the murder of at least one of your classmates, as well as trying to solve the larger mystery of who, or what, is
                controlling this killing game.
